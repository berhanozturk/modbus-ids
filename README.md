# âš¡ Modbus IDS â€“ Industrial Intrusion Detection System

Modbus IDS is a lightweight Python-based intrusion detection system designed for industrial environments. It monitors Modbus TCP traffic, detects suspicious activity such as invalid function codes or high-frequency requests, and can optionally block malicious IP addresses using iptables.

Ideal for energy systems, SCADA networks, industrial IoT, and PLC-based infrastructures.
